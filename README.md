# sea-shanty-api
This is a public API that allows users to receive titles and lyrics from a large collection of sea shanties!

# Homepage
The API homepage can be found at http://sea-shanty-api.herokuapp.com. Feel free to head over there and find some cool shanties!

# Database
The collection of sea shanties is deployed on a MongoDB database. It was created by scraping the website http://mainsailcafe.com which contains the lyrics to hundreds of sea shanties. The scraping was done with a Python script, using mainly the 'requests' and 'BeautifulSoup' modules. The script can be found in this repository.
