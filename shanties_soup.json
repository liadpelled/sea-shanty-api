        ["As I walked out one morning down by the Sligo dock,", "I overhead an Irishman conversing with Tapscott;", "Good morning, Mr. Tapscott, would you be after telling to me,", "Have you ever a ship bound for New York in the State of Amerikee."],
        ["Oh, yes, my pretty Irish boy, I have a ship or two,", "They're laying at the wharf there, waiting for a crew;", "They are New York packets, and on Friday they will sail,", "At present she is taking in one thousand bags of meal."],
        ["Straightaway then I started, 'twas on the yellow-grog road,", "Such roars of mille-murder! oh, the like was never known;", "And there I paid my passage down in solid Irish gold,", "It's often times that I sat down and wished myself at home."],
        ["The very day we started, 'twas on the one of May,", "The captain he came upon the deck, these words to us did say;", "Cheer up, my hearty Irish blades, don't let your courage fail.", "Today I'll serve you pork and beans, tomorrow yellow meal."],
        ["One day as we were sailing in the channel of St. James,", "A north-west wind came up to us, and drove us back again;", "Bad luck to the Josh A. Walker, and the day that she set sail,", "For the dirty sailors broke upon my chest, and stole my yellow meal."],
        ["But now I'm in America, and working upon the canal,", "To cross the ocean in one of those boats, I know I never shall,", "But I'll cross it in a great big ship that carries both meat and sail,", "Where I'll get lashings of corned meat, and none of your yellow meal."]
